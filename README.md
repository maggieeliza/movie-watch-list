# movie-watch-list
This program creates a customizable watch list for movies
When the program is run, the user will be given 8 options; add to the list, view the list, mark a movie as watched, remove a movie from the list, remove all movies from the list, sort the list alphabetically, print the number of movies on the list, and quit the program.
